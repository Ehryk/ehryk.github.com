"Analysis Paralysis"

### The Requirements Pit

"Perfection is when... nothing left to take away"

Hah!

> The word "gathering" seems to imply a
tribe of happy analysts, foraging for nuggets of wisdom that are lying on the ground all around them while the Pastoral Symphony plays gently in the background. "Gathering" implies that the requirements are already thereâ€”you need merely find them, place them
in your basket, and be merrily on your way.
>
> It doesn't quite work that way. Requirements rarely lie on the surface. Normally, they're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions,
misconceptions, and politics.

Don't gather - dig

Separate policies and requirements

Get the why, not just the way

Don't overspecify in requirements - deliberately generic

Requirements == need, not architecture

Abstractions live longer than details

### Solving Impossible Puzzles

King of Phrygia's Knot:

> The Gordian Knot is a legend of Phrygian Gordium associated with Alexander the Great. It is often used as a metaphor for an intractable problem (disentangling an "impossible" knot) solved easily by loophole or "thinking outside the box" ("cutting the Gordian knot")

"Alexandrian solution": break it with a sword!

Absolute constraints vs. preconceived notions

If you fully knew the box, you wouldn't have to think outside of it.

### Not Until You're Ready

Listen to what nags you

"Inner Tennis"

### The Specification Trap

Diminishing returns with increased specificity

### Circles and Arrows

"Don't give in to the false authority of a method"

"The class diagram IS the application": sounds like LINQ to SQL
