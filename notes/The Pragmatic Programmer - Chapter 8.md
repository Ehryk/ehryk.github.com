### Ubiquitous Automation

I once drove a model T, it had a gear shift on the right side of the steering wheel (3 forward, one reverse) and a ignition timing shifter on the left that had to be adjusted for various throttle positions and RPM combinations - not a trivial operation!

Now my Mazda requires me to control a MAF sensor as I drive that controls fuel injection and timing - Model T mode!

Don't use manual procedures

make files, how novel :)

### Ruthless Testing

"A good project may well have more test code than production code"
^ s/good/expensive/

 - Integration Testing
 - Validation and Verification
 - Resource Exhaustion, Errors, and Recovery
 - Performance Testing
 - Usability Testing

"Testing the tests" <-- enter the downward spiral

### It's All Writing

"The palest ink is better than the best memory"

"Embrace documentation" - give it a big ol' hug

English = just another programming language

Worse than meaningless names: misleading names

Automate the documentation generation

Markdown!!!

### Great Expectations

"pays only abstract bills" haha

"managing expectations" - somewhat elitist?

check our consultant privilege!

Surprises = bad thing

### Pride and Prejudice

Accept responsibility
