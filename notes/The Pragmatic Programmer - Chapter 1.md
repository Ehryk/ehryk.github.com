### Forward

"Paid attention to what they where doing while they were doing it"

Automate project meetings = YAS

"Extra Dimension" of Quality Without A Name - I see this in produced products, in styles of code, and appreciate it (usually silently)

### Preface

Programming as a craft - slick, elegant readable code = sign of good craftsmanship

Not be wedded to a particular technology - similar to RDI's philosophy and approach

1. Early/Fast Adopter 4/5

Kaizen - small continuous improvements

Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosphy
=========

### The Cat Ate My Source Code

"The greatest of all weaknesses is the fear of being weak"

Be honest about shortcomings

When you accept responsibility, expect to be held accountable

Don't lay blame

Solutions not excuses!

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it _can't_ be done, explain what _can_ be done.

Tell your cat first, haha

Challenges - When a company or service gives a lame excuse, I typically let the first one slide; things happen. If they ever give a second one, I don't return.

### Software Entropy

Software Rot - interesting take on it; I have only viewed this in terms of static code (literally) in the face of everprescient, unrelenting progress. How can it ruin internally?
From wiki: "This is not a physical phenomenon: the software does not actually decay, but rather suffers from a lack of being responsive and updated with respect to the changing environment in which it resides."

"Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired."

"You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass of a project. If you continue to think like that, then you'd better plan on getting a dumpster, or moving to another neighborhood. Don't let entropy win."
haha - fight the entropy!

Putting out fires - sounds like Monica's team's recent review of ALVIN

Lots of broken windows on the intranet - difficult to begin the window fixing process
When in between rock and a hard place, the first windows often get broken, like on BH

### Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs

I call bullshit: no single pot, in posession of a travelling soldier, could contain enough volume of soup to feed even a tiny village with what could be considered a 'meal'. Are the three of them hauling a cauldron around?

"Pretend it's not important" that you want your changes implemented - why?

Tip 5: Be a catalyst for change
Tip 6: Remember the big picture

The frog story is also bullshit, the scientist who did this had first removed their brains and was testing only musculature reflex. The next scientist had a faulty methodology with dubious claims (0.02deg C rise to boiling in 2.5 hours means the water started at 82deg C, which is lethal, claimed they didn't 'appear' to have moved). 

> Or perhaps the story began with E.W. Scripture, who wrote The New Psychology in 1897. He cited earlier German research: “. . . a live frog can actually be boiled without a movement if the water is heated slowly enough; in one experiment, the temperature was raised at the rate of 0.002 [degrees Celsius] per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2.5 hours without having moved.

> Well, the numbers just don’t seem right. If the water comes to a boil, that means a final temperature of 100 degrees Celsius. In that case, the frog would have to have been put into the water at 82 degrees Celsius. Surely, the frog would have died immediately. Scripture also wrote that the frog was found “without having moved.” How do you convince a frog not to move for more than two hours?

> Then there’s the issue of the real-life behavior of frogs. First, a frog cannot jump out of boiling water. Remember the last time you dropped some egg white into boiling water: the proteins coagulated into a mess of thin, white strands. Unfortunately, the proteins in the frog’s skinny legs would do the same thing. So the frog in boiling water could not jump anywhere. It would die a nasty death.

> Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and Professor Doug Melton of Harvard University both agree on this point.

> Second, a frog would notice the water getting hot. Dr. Victor Hutchison, a herpetologist at the University of Oklahoma, has dealt with frogs throughout his professional life. Indeed, one of his current research interests is “the physiological ecology of thermal relations of amphibians and reptiles.” Professor Hutchison states, “The legend is entirely incorrect! The ‘critical thermal maxima’ [the maximum temperature an animal can bear] of many species of frogs have been determined by several investigators. In this procedure, the water in which a frog is submerged is heated gradually at about 2 degrees Fahrenheit per minute. As the temperature of the water is gradually increased, the frog will eventually become more and more active in attempts to escape the heated water.”

> So real-life experiments show that the frog-in-boiling-water story is wrong. If only this fact could make it into real life, too. ❧

Challenges: How to tell if making stone soup vs frog soup? If there's living things getting burned in there!

### Good-enough Software

"How _good_ do you want your software to be?"

I struggle with this

Tip 7: Make quality a requirements issue

"Great software today is often preferable to perfect software tomorrow."

Like painting!

"Tracer bullets" sounds like an exciting chapter

Challenges: Depends on the purpose of the software. OS: wait until all the bugs are out. IDE/browser: some bugs. Projects/Experimental: simpler.

### Your Knowledge Portfolio

Knowledge is an _expiring_ asset? oh noes!

Diversification is the key to long term success

Tip 8 - Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio

Learn a new language every year! Great goal!
Technical book each quarter - book club!

"cross-pollination of ideas"

Take it as a personal challenge to find the answer.

### Communicate!

Better to be looked over than overlooked?

What
Interest
Sophistication
Detail
Own
Motivate

To be listened to, listen to others

Challenges: MOAR BOOKS!?!?! Use WISDOM acronym for next presentation/talk

### Other Notes

Oxford dictionary downloaded and looked up the words I highlighted in the kindle app!
Typo in the table of contents. Kaizen!
