### Flat Earth - Bible Verses [@ 4:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=4m33s)

It's not accurate to say `...bible tells you, several places, Isaiah 40:22, that the earth is a circle, a sphere`. A sphere is never mentioned, and more verses imply flatness than roundness, and one verse is not 'several':

 - "Daniel 4:10-11. In Daniel, the king “saw a tree of great height at the centre of the earth...reaching with its top to the sky and visible to the earth's farthest bounds.” Only with a flat earth could tall tree be visible from “the earth's farthest bounds,” — this is impossible on a spherical earth.
   - Theological rebuttal: The strength of Daniel 4:10-11 as an argument for a flat Earth is considerably reduced by the fact that this part of the Book of Daniel recounts a dream experienced by the Persian king during a fit of madness. Thus, it does not necessarily refer to an actually existing tree or make any statements about real cosmology. This fact would seem to indicate that biblical literalists do not even know how to read the Bible properly. It also ignores that the New Testament claims that the Devil showed Jesus the entire world from the top of a mountain, which would not be possible on a spherical Earth:
 - Matthew 4:8: "Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world"
 - Luke 4:5: "And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time."
 - Isaiah 40:22: "He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its people are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy, and spreads them out like a tent to live in." 
   - Indeed, this quote is used to prove that bible claims that the earth is spherical. **Some scholars point out that Isaiah never uses the Modern Hebrew word for sphere Kadur anywhere**[1]. It is not clear whether this is relevant, seeing as the interpretation of the word Kadur in the bible is disputed[2]
 - Isaiah 11:12 "And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth."
 - Revelation 7:1 "And after these things I saw four angels standing on four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree." As with the Daniel quote, this cannot be taken literally; the events described in Revelation are a series of visions, rather than an accurate description of the world. Another interpretation of this verse is that four corners of the earth don't refer to literal four corners but to cardinal directions, which is further supported by the description of the four winds which are commonly referenced by their cardinal direction.

1 implies 'circle', 6 imply 'flat'

The only other 'round' reference I could find was answers in genesis using Job 26:10, however it's only modern translations that are adding the roundness: the KJV reads "He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end."

### Flat Earth - Middle Age Myth [@ 4:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=4m25s)

While I'm guilty of retaining some lingering notions of those 'flat earthers in the dark ages,' I was somewhat aware of its mythical status and mostly find the flat earth an excellent analogy for other things (such as a great number of people beliving something, while simultaneously being verifiably wrong, or the number of believers of a claim having no bearing on its truth value). Unfortunately this has propagated and most people never bother to verify its authenticity, but as depressing as poll results may be (or the actual number of people who think it), I submit that this is no hidden fact and is and has been well known among historians for a long time. 

> "According to Stephen Jay Gould, "there never was a period of 'flat earth darkness' among scholars (regardless of how the public at large may have conceptualized our planet both then and now). Greek knowledge of sphericity never faded, and all major medieval scholars accepted the Earth's roundness as an established fact of cosmology."[3] Historians of science David Lindberg and Ronald Numbers point out that "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference".[4]
> 
> Historian Jeffrey Burton Russell says the flat-earth error flourished most between 1870 and 1920, and had to do with the ideological setting created by struggles over evolution.[5] Russell claims "with extraordinary [sic] few exceptions no educated person in the history of Western Civilization from the third century B.C. onward believed that the earth was flat", and credits histories by John William Draper, Andrew Dickson White, and Washington Irving for popularizing the flat-earth myth.[6]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth

It's similarly frustrating that:

11 percent of U.S. respondents to a poll thought HTML5 was an STD,
42 percent thought a motherboard was the deck of a cruise ship,
27 percent of respondents incorrectly identified a "gigabyte" as "an insect commonly found in South America,"
18 percent mistakenly believed Blu-ray was some sort of marine animal,
13 percent thought an MP3 was one of the robots in "Star Wars,"
12 percent thought USB was the acronym for a country in Europe.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/05/html-an-std-tech-survey_n_4904310.html

However this doesn't mean that educated people (especially those in a technology field) and I suspect that this is the same with actual historians and professors on the Flat Earth Middle Ages Myth and what they teach in their textbooks and classrooms.

.... and I'm only 5:24 into this 2 hour video, so this doesn't bode well for my weekend.

### Phlogiston  [@ 4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=4m30s)

This is well known to be incorrect. Since Wikipedia is the most up to date source of collective human knowledge, then I'll just hand it to WP: 

>"The phlogiston theory is an obsolete scientific theory that postulated a fire-like element called phlogiston, contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. The name comes from the Ancient Greek φλογιστόν phlogistón (burning up), from φλόξ phlóx (flame). It was first stated in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. The theory attempted to explain burning processes such as combustion and rusting, which are now collectively known as oxidation."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory

So what's his point? Science was wrong once? While the Flat Earth was a different beast because he was talking about a modern day myth of belief about the knowledge of past time periods, the Phlogiston theory was refuted in the 1780s by Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and isn't taught (by anywhere that's accredited, at least, other than in a historical context).

In any case, it's not a _currently believed_ myth of the past, nor is it even a _myth_. It was a proposed scientific model that was replaced long ago. Doesn't belong in this list as he implies it.

So - science has been wrong. On lots of things. And is surely still is in many areas. And?

### Ptolemy [@ 5:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=5m25s)

Right here Missler demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding that has underpinned every argument leading up to this point in the video, as well as the article I read by him earlier: `Ptolemy of Alexandria has gone down in history as opposing two great truths in science`.

Science has no great truths, and it is not an argument from authority from 'those elite, snobbish scientists.' If the evidence indeed pointed at a geocentric solar system, then the scientific models would reflect that. **THERE ARE NO GREAT TRUTHS IN SCIENCE** - only the best current explanation that fits the observed data.

> "Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge"[1]) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science

And to his second point, Ptolemy's "proof" might as well stay in quotes because "There is no 4th dimension because **I** can't visualize it" is completely invalid as a proof and is merely an argument from personal incredulity. Ptolemy did have a proof he advanced that is not correct based on modern mathematics and geometry, but it was **NOT** equivalent to the argument that he couldn't visualize it, it was based on geometry and orthogonality.

> "Because you found something difficult to understand, or are unaware of how it works, you made out like it's probably not true."

https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/personal-incredulity

That argument would be equivalent to saying `I, Eric Menze, don't personally know how to perform Open Heart surgery. Obviously, then, it can't be done`.

(that aside, Ptolemy did put forth a proof based on the current understanding of geometric laws at the time on one of his books _On Distance_: http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/STG/ma8/papers/anogelo/hist4dim.html )

Again, this is just saying "the best thinking at the time was incorrect at this specific instance". No one I'm aware of has ever argued otherwise.

### Luminiferous Aether [@ 6:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=6m15s)

Just another example of "yep, we were wrong once."

> "Aether theory was dealt another blow when the Galilean transformation and Newtonian dynamics were both modified by Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, giving the mathematics of Lorentzian electrodynamics a new, "non-aether" context.[A 18] Unlike most major shifts in scientific thought, special relativity was adopted by the scientific community remarkably quickly, consistent with Einstein's later comment that the laws of physics described by the Special Theory were "ripe for discovery" in 1905.[B 10] Max Planck's early advocacy of the special theory, along with the elegant formulation given to it by Hermann Minkowski, contributed much to the rapid acceptance of special relativity among working scientists."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether#End_of_aether.3F

Part of the reason SR and GR (special and general relativity, respectively) were accepted so quickly is because numerous fundamental problems with _LAe_ were already widely known: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_luminiferous_aether#Crisis

### Velocity of Light [@ 6:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=6m48s)

Here's another fundamental misunderstanding of Science by Missler, which is extremely common when Science is viewed through the lens of religion:

It didn't take them 50 years to accept that the speed of light was finite because Scientists are stubborn dicks. Think about the "empirical data" offered up: `Olaf Roemer witnessed the eclipse of a moon on Saturn[sic]`. One of the core concepts of science is repeatability; I can write down all sorts of "empirical data" (numbers), but **scientists are NOT CONVINCED** by this (nor should they be), by taking it on my authority, or trust, or my position. Planetary eclipses are not repeatable at will, and the argument "But I wrote it down, guys!" goes nowhere in the scientific community.

I added [sic] because Ole Rømer was observing a moon of Jupiter, Io.

The entire phrasiology is entirely misleading in how it portrays the scientific methodology. 

>"Rømer's theory was controversial at the time he announced it, and he never convinced the director of the Royal Observatory, Giovanni Domenico Cassini, to fully accept it. However, it quickly gained support among other natural philosophers of the period, such as Christiaan Huygens and Isaac Newton. It was finally confirmed nearly two decades after Rømer's death, with the explanation in 1729 of stellar aberration by the English astronomer James Bradley."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer%27s_determination_of_the_speed_of_light

That word - _confirmed_ - is the key here. While he made various contributions and progress during his lifetime, your 'character' and 'past accomplishments' mean nothing to science. He came up with a result which, even though it was true, was not easily reproducible (until the next eclipse of Jupiter) and even then relied on the relatively terrible optics of the time and was just fundamentally an unsound **reason** to believe the speed of light to be finite. 

> "Rømer's view that the velocity of light was finite was not fully accepted until measurements of stellar aberration were made in 1727 by James Bradley (1693–1762).[14] Bradley, who would be Halley's successor as Astronomer Royal, calculated a value of 8 minutes 13 seconds for light to travel from the Sun to Earth.[14] Ironically, stellar aberration had first been observed by Cassini and (independently) by Picard in 1671, but neither astronomer was able to give an explanation for the phenomenon.[3] Bradley's work also laid to rest any remaining serious objections to the Keplerian model of the Solar System."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B8mer's_determination_of_the_speed_of_light

The true shift in scientific thought came about NOT when someone happened to measure a one-off, not easily reproducable event, nor when Cassini and Picard stumbled upon the right answer, but when Bradley both had an easily testable, everywhere and anytime (night time) reproducable way coupled with an explanation (model). Happening upon the right answer through revelation or other non-reproducable (by others) is not respected in science.

... and he's still droning on about how it "even the physicists, it took them FIFTY YEARS to swallow the meaning of empirical data." Totally wrong. Data is meaningless unless it's reproducable.

### Myths of Today [@ 8:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=8m27s)

#### Evolution [@ 8:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=8m30s)

He says evolution and then calls it 'biogenesis'? His conflation of the two demonstrates a lack of understanding of the theories and their scopes; 'evolution' = existing replicating life changing over time and adapting to its environment. Biogenesis (aka abiogenesis) = the arising of life from non living matter. Each can be individually correct while the other is false, or both true or both correct - _THEY ARE NOT THE EQUIVALENT!_

Roughly speaking, the way creationists use the term 'evolution' corresponds loosely to multiple theories that have a common thread of 'Origins':
1. (optionally) A Universe From Nothing (or similar pre-bang model) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaGktVQdNg _Pre-Big Bang_
1. Cosmology  (Big Bang being the current leading model): _Big Bang to Dust Clouds_
1. Nebular Hypothesis (SNDM currently): _Dust Clouds to Stars and Planets_
1. Geology and Chemistry (Tectonic Plates, Geothermal cooling, and Crystals): _Fiery Magma Planet to self-replicating chemicals and crystals_
1. Abiogenesis: _Chemicals to Living matter_
1. Evolution and Natural Selection: _Living matter to species diversity and, among other flora and fauna, humans_

As for the writers who "demolished" "evolution":

##### Michael Behe

> "Behe correctly dissects the Darwinian theory into three parts: descent with modification, natural selection and mutation. Descent with modification gives him no problems, nor does natural selection. They are “trivial” and “modest” notions, respectively. Do his creationist fans know that Behe accepts as “trivial” the fact that we are African apes, cousins of monkeys, descended from fish?
> …
> … Behe, as is normal at the grotesquely ill-named Discovery Institute (a tax-free charity, would you believe?), where he is a senior fellow, has bypassed the peer-review procedure altogether, gone over the heads of the scientists he once aspired to number among his peers, and appealed directly to a public that — as he and his publisher know — is not qualified to rumble him."

http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2007/06/29/michael-behes-book-as-reviewed-by-richard-dawkins/

> "Behe's claims about the irreducible complexity of essential cellular structures have been rejected by the vast majority of the scientific community,[3][4] and his own biology department at Lehigh University published an official statement opposing Behe's views and intelligent design.[5][6]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe

##### Michael Denton

Denton also works for the Discovery Institute and bypasses peer review. He has also no longer supports biblical creationism and proposes divinely-driven directed evolution 

> "Denton is best known for his 1985 book Evolution: A Theory in Crisis, in the book he presented a systematic critique of neo-darwinism ranging from paleontology, fossils, homology, molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry and argued that evidence of design exists in nature. He describes himself as an evolutionist, and he has rejected biblical creationism. ... Since writing the book Denton has changed many of his views on evolution, however he still believes that the existence of life is a matter of design.[7] ... Denton still accepts design and embraces a non-Darwinian evolutionary theory. He denies that randomness accounts for the biology of organisms, he has proposed an evolutionary theory which is a “directed evolution” in his book Nature's Destiny (1998). Life according to Denton did not exist until initial conditions of the universe were fine tuned (see Fine-tuned Universe).[8] ... He argues for a law-like evolutionary unfolding of life.[10]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Denton

##### Phillip Johnson

Johnson is a law professor who is presenting analysis of the relevant evolution based court cases... not exactly qualified to 'demolish' evolution on qualifications, but even so his arguments (which stand or fall on their own merit) are terrible as well. 

> "Eugenie Scott wrote that the book "teaches little that is accurate about either the nature of science, or the topic of evolution. It is recommended neither by scientists nor educators."[2] Scott pointed out in a second review that "the criticisms of evolution [Johnson] offers are immediately recognizable as originating with the "scientific" creationists".[3] Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould's review of the book stated that it contained "no weighing of evidence, no careful reading of literature on all sides, no full citation of sources (the book does not even contain a bibliography) and occasional use of scientific literature only to score rhetorical points". Gould also pointed out that the use of legal criteria, in which a "shadow of a doubt" can suffice to destroy a theory, was inappropriate in science, since "science is not a discipline that claims to establish certainty".[4]"

#### Velocity of Light [@ 9:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=9m10s)

Ah, good ol' c-decay. 

> "One of the largest problems facing a Young Earth is the starlight problem, which runs as follows: (1) there are galaxies billions of light-years from earth, meaning it would take light from their stars billions of years to reach us; (2) we can see these galaxies, so their starlight has already arrived; (3) therefore the universe must be billions of years old.[40] As an old earth (and universe) is not acceptable (it conflicts with the Bible-based age of the earth), alternative explanations are advanced by Young Earth supporters. One is that God created starlight when he created the universe six thousand years ago and the age of distant starlight is skewed because the Bible refers to God stretching the universe (e.g. Isaiah 51:13.) Those who do not accept the biblical explanation of God stretching the universe consider the age of distant starlight as deceptive and the explanation is not entirely satisfactory, as the first implies a God who deceives.[40] A second, posed by Barry Setterfield, that the speed of light was faster in the past than it is now (the theory is called C-decay, from the cosmological symbol C representing the speed of light).[40] Setterfield's theory, however, would produce consequences which have not been observed,[40] and has been refuted by other creationists such as Russell Humphreys.[41]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationist_cosmologies#The_.22starlight_problem.22

> "c is not just "the speed of light." It is a universal constant which is observed as unchanging no matter who is observing it. It can be thought of as the speed which all objects fly through the four dimensions of spacetime - if you move along "space" you have less of the speed left to go through "time" and you experience the effect of time dilation. "c" is also used in many equations related to electromagnetic phenomenon such as Maxwell's equations; and it is the fact that these equations mention c without asking what the speed is relative to as should happen in a relativistic universe that lead to the notion that c is constant for all observers. It is also a key component in Einstein's famous E = mc2 equation; in this case, if c was larger in the past, then matter would have had more unit of energy per unit of mass in the past. Spontaneously losing this energy would at least violate the law of conservation of energy in some way.
> The speed of light may be intimately related to two other physical constants: the vacuum permittivity ε0 and the vacuum permeability μ0:
> c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\epsilon_0}}
> Therefore, a variation on the value of c implies variation either on ε0 or μ0 or both. These properties of space are measured in experiments that don't even involve light, such as experiments with capacitors and magnets.
> c-decay, therefore, does not simply mean that "light travels a bit faster;" it means that the very fabric of reality would be subject to change in the temporal dimension. So believe us, anyone who postulates that "c may decay" needs to understand that it has very serious and very far reaching consequences. One of the most far-reaching being that the speed of light changing with time implies that energy is not conserved."

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/C-decay

#### The Nebular Hypothesis [@ 9:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=9m52s)

> "Most of us have been taught that the planets of our solar system came out of the sun. It may come as a surprise that there are serious scientific difficulties with this presumption. In fact, a careful analysis of existing evidence suggests some surprising alternative possibilities."

As anecdotal as it is, **I** was never taught that planets were 'ejected' or 'came out' of the sun; nor do the _current_ variants of the Nebular Hypothesis. Because of his age, and the relatively recent age of the most modern and supported variant (SNDM / Solar Nebular Disk Model, introduced to the english-speaking world in 1972) I then checked to make sure 'us' [as in Missler's generation] wasn't taught the Laplacian variant, and it is quite doubtful that it was still taught or in any textbooks during that era.

> "While the Laplacian nebular model dominated in the 19th century, it encountered a number of difficulties. The main problem was angular momentum distribution between the Sun and planets. The planets have 99% of the angular momentum, and this fact could not be explained by the nebular model.[5] As a result this theory of planet formation was largely abandoned at the beginning of the 20th century."

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis

However, there was no clear leading theory throughout the time when Missler would have been pursuing an education:

> "The fall of the Laplacian model stimulated scientists to find a replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories were proposed including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), tidal model of Jeans (1917), accretion model of Otto Schmidt (1944), protoplanet theory of William McCrea (1960) and finally capture theory of Michael Woolfson.[5] In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory.[5] None of these attempts was completely successful and many of the proposed theories were descriptive.

> "The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the solar nebular disk model (SNDM)—can be traced to the Soviet astronomer Victor Safronov.[6] His book Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets,[7] which was translated to English in 1972, had a long lasting effect on the way scientists think about the formation of the planets.[8] In this book almost all major problems of the planetary formation process were formulated and some of them solved. Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of George Wetherill, who discovered runaway accretion.[5]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis

Because of this, I can empathize with his distrust in the scientific process in this area, as there were competing models for planetary formation during his educational development. However, this does not excuse intellectual laziness in even a cursory review of _modern_ scientific theory; the resolution of the angular momentum problem with the Laplacian variants and other problems were well known over a hundred years ago, all replacements since it fell out of favor in ~1901 addressed these issues and the most current model had thoroughly addressed most, if not all, of the problems in the original Laplacian model (though this is not to suggest the current theory is without unsolved problems, just that it is the best current understanding we have with the observations and data we have to work with currently). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_hypothesis#Solar_nebular_model:_achievements_and_problems for a full list.

The fact that these wildly different variants of the same theory all share the same name, **despite SNDM being as opposite as you can get** to the statement "the planets of our solar system came out of the sun" is perhaps unfortunate, but only relevant to the willfully ignorant. To equate 'The Nebular Hypothesis' to only the Laplacian or other very early variants is to make a Category Error (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake) similar to the following:

Computer Science was developed by some crazy people like Turing and Ada Lovelace that didn't even have access to computers (irrelevant character ad hominems; arguments stand or fall separate of the arguer)
Out of their work came C, which is prone to memory leaks (not technically true, but kind of correct from an overgeneralizing perspective)
Our education system is still teaching computer science based on C (kind of, since most modern languages are C-like or heavily influenced)
Thus our education system is teaching students terrible things and there are memory leaks in ALL THE CODE! (flawed conclusion even if all the premises were true, which they aren't)

Now this is clearly not true; many _modern_ languages handle memory manangement themselves and couldn't be further from the Malloc and memory leaking origins.

Similarly, _modern_ variants Nebular Hypothesis have largely solved the initial issues, and are substantiated by such an exponential amount of additional data that was not available prior to key developments such as satellites, optics, computers, other solar system observations, aerospace and aviation, etc. that to even consider Laplacian NH would negate just about everything we have observed, from our solar system to the 1,822 currently known exoplanets...and it's been abandoned since the early 1900s.

Not only is observation evidence of other solar systems paramount to the modern theory, computers' role in this cannot be understated. By simply modelling gravity and setting initial parameters, very disparate solar systems can arise, and you can literally write this in javascript and simulate it in a browser. While non-rotating initial conditions are very unfavorable to planetary formation (understandably, everything coalesces into the center before resolving any orbital stability), most [initially] rotating Nebula will produce at least one star with a few planetescimals, that would roughly correspond to terrestrial planets in size.

(Gas Giants formation is currently an unsolved problem within modern SNDM, however I suspect a more accurate modelling of smaller particles, gas distribution and solar winds would be be integral to their formation, and this is currently NOT written in Javascript for browsers :-P)

I'm also noting the use of the Gish Gallop and multiple ad hominems throughout. Ad hominems is where you discredit the person rather than their argument ("Yeah well those are good points, but he's a wife beater!" doesn't invalidate the argument)

#### Solar System's Angular Momentum [@ 11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=11m11s)

Chuck says `There is no way to explain` this. So what do you call the following from the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_?

> "The angular momentum problem that defeated Kant and Laplace—why the planets have most of the solar system’s angular momentum while the Sun has most of the mass—can now be approached in a cosmic context. All stars having masses that range from slightly above the mass of the Sun to the smallest known masses rotate more slowly than an extrapolation based on the rotation rate of stars of higher mass would predict. Accordingly, these sunlike stars show the same deficit in angular momentum as the Sun itself.
> 
> The answer to how this loss could have occurred seems to lie in the solar wind. The Sun and other stars of comparable mass have outer atmospheres that are slowly but steadily expanding into space. Stars of higher mass do not exhibit such stellar winds. The loss of angular momentum associated with this loss of mass to space is sufficient to reduce the rate of the Sun’s rotation. Thus, the planets preserve the angular momentum that was in the original solar nebula, but the Sun has gradually slowed down in the 4.6 billion years since it formed."

#### "Other Enigmas" [@ 12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=12m36s)

Planets sharing similar rotational features, especially those near each other, is exactly a prediction of most nebular hypothesi, including the SNDM. None of this is particularly "enigmatic." It certainly is no indication that there are planetary `pairs` nor that they `came from ... somewhere else`. 23 random people in a room have a 50% chance of sharing the same birthday. Doesn't mean there's any significance.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem

#### Martian Dichotomy [@ 13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=13m24s)

There are three leading, evidentiary supported models for the dichotomy of the topology of Mars' surface (one hemisphere having 93% of the craters, as he puts it). Also note that they aren't proper hemispheres or half-divisions, the flatness of the northern lowlands (1/3 of the surface) is being contrasted with the southern highlands (2/3 of the surface). Gee, it sure sounds a lot less spooky when the elevation difference is brought into the picture, especially since any evidence of impacts on lowlands would be wiped away by thermal tectonic processes.

> "The northern lowlands comprise about one-third of the surface of Mars and are relatively flat, with occasional impact craters. The other two-thirds of the Martian surface are the highlands of the southern hemisphere. The difference in elevation between the hemispheres is dramatic. Because of the density of impact craters, scientists believe the southern hemisphere to be far older than the northern plains.[clarification needed] [13] The heavily cratered southern highlands date back to the period of heavy bombardment. Three major hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the crustal dichotomy: endogenic (by mantle processes), single impact, or multiple impact. Both impact-related hypotheses involve processes that could have occurred before the end of the primordial bombardment, implying that the crustal dichotomy has its origins early in the history of Mars."

#### Uniformity Delusions [@ 14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4AtHLcU9_w#t=14m49s)

He's wrong on two counts in the interplatetary debris; 
1. It's not 100 tons, it's ~44,000 tons of space debris adding to Earth's mass annually, and yet
1. Earth loses a net ~55,000 tons of mass anually (remember 1 tonne ~= 1.1 tons): 

> "• Earth gains about 40,000 tonnes of dust every year, the remnants of the formation of the solar system, which are attracted by our gravity and become part of the matter in our planet. Our planet is actually made from all that starstuff.
> • NASA says that Earth gains about 160 tonnes of matter a year because the global temperature is going up: "If we are adding energy to the system, the mass must go up." Oh, those crazy thermodynamics.
> • Of course, having more people or building stuff doesn't add any mass to the planet. Humans and things are made with the matter that is already in the planet. It's just being transformed.
> • Most of the rockets and satellites that we launch to Earth orbit eventually fall down back to Earth, so no real effect here.
> • Earth's core loses energy over time. It's like a giant nuclear reactor that burns fuel. Less energy means less mass. 16 tonnes of that are gone every year. Not much.
> • And here's the big mass loss: about 95,000 tonnes of hydrogen and 1,600 tones of helium escape Earth every year. They are too light for gravity to keep them around, so they get lost. Gone into space.
> The result: the rough estimate is -50,000 tonnes every year. Which is about 0.000000000000001% less mass every year."

## Wrapping it up this weekend

This was all I could get through for this weekend. It took me over three hours to parse what Missler would gloss over as though it was 'obviously' true, get context around it where needed, find the scientific viewpoint of the issue, and write up my thoughts with references and quotations for only 15 minutes of his two hour video.

This is the true cost of the Gish Gallop - it takes so much energy to clean up the mess that is made, that it gets hard to even be cohesive, and what it usually will boil down to is personal trust and charisma. Missler's program sounds better than my ranty dissections, and just make me off to be an asshole anyway, out to tear down things that may interest people or bring them joy (like psychics or homeopaths or religions). This is why I completely understand why many scientists refuse to engage with certain types of debaters - there is no way to accomplish anything when the other person is playing a different game.

## On "Dr." Chuck Missler

### Doctor?

The title of the video contains 'Dr. Chuck Missler,' and this was rather curious.

> "Missler has a PhD from Louisiana Baptist University a controversial, unaccredited on-line university. Interestingly:
> 
> ... by purchasing and reading a book by Chuck Missler and writing a short paper, one can receive college credit from Louisiana Baptist University. Assist News quoted Missler as explaining that LBU "has offered course credits for those that do a 'reflective paper' on what they got out of it". In addition to the three semester hours credit, people "also get a certificate for it." According to Missler's website, the university allows students to transfer "credits" from Missler's Koinonia Institute for "up to half of the credit hour requirements for a graduate degree" at Louisiana Baptist University."

This is upsetting because it demeans the hard work and effort made by those who put in a great deal of effort to get their higher degrees from accredited universities.

### Calvary Chapel

This is written by another christian (assumed since there are bible verses quoted in the context of them bearing weight) and he has long lists of 'Misslerisms' (mistruths, errors and inaccuracies by Missler)

### Other Christian Perspectives on Missler

> "There are many things that I myself have fallen prey too and sometimes it’s been difficult for me to want to believe I was fooled.  I am no one special, but I do my utter best to listen to the Holy Spirit’s warnings and I ask Jesus for forgiveness of these things and rectify my errors so that I do not lead people astray. I sincerely pray that these pastors that I myself love very much,  take heed of what I have written here and re-evaluate their position regarding what the Bible says about false teachers and how it’s even possible for the elect to be deceived."

http://www.discerningtheworld.com/2010/02/17/dr-chuck-missler-swansat-and-the-auric-currency/

> " My worry about Chuck Missler being a false teacher and not just making normal human errors or misjudgements, grew stronger and strong. ... Other Christians have discerned the truth about Missler and go into even more detail as to the odd bedfellows at conferences and other worrisome teachings and connections. Please take heed and be careful of trusting in this teacher. I have thanked God for warning me."

### Hits v. Misses

While it's always easy to just make lots of predictions and claims and hope some stick, misses need to be counted as well (this is why psychics and mystics are convincing to some - it looks like they are obtaining hidden knowledge but when researchers count the misses v. hits they're basically just using simple techniques to get the person to give up the info after tactical guessing techniques. Audiences and people forget all the times they were wrong first).

Here's him being wrong about Obama's birth certificate, which was produced and verified. His many, many misses just fade into obscurity.

## The Gish Gallop

At the outset, I'm noting the use of the Gish Gallop:

The technique of rapid-fire statements of 'truthiness' (a term Colbert made up) in order to appear to win a debate was named after a popular Creationist debater, Duane Gish. It is a notable technique to 'appear' victorious through both showmanship and confusion, but it does not produce quality arguments and raises suspicion whenever I see or hear the technique employed - since I inherently operate by breaking each item down and evaluating it thoroughly, I can't even begin to operate on large lists and this is exploited by some by less honorable motivations than winning a debate.

### On the technique

> "The Gish Gallop is the debating technique of drowning the opponent in such a torrent of small arguments that their opponent cannot possibly answer or address each one in real time. More often than not, these myriad arguments are full of half-truths, lies, and straw-man arguments — the only condition is that there be many of them, not that they be particularly compelling on their own. They may be escape hatches or "gotcha" arguments that are specifically designed to be brief, but take a long time to unravel. Thus, galloping is frequently used in timed debates (especially by creationists) to overwhelm one's opponent.

Examples are commonly found in "list" articles that may claim to show "100 reasons for" something, or "50 reasons against" something. At this sort of level, with dozens upon dozens of minor arguments, each individual point on the list may only be a single sentence or two, and many may be a repeat or vague re-wording of a previous one. This is the intention: although it is trivial amount of effort on the part of the galloper to make a point, particularly if they just need to re-iterate an existing one a different way, a refutation may take much longer and someone addressing will be unable to refute all points in a similarly short order. If even one argument in a Gish Gallop is left standing at the end, or addressed insufficiently, the galloper will attempt to claim victory.

The term was coined by Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education, named after creationist Duane Gish.[1] Creationists are fond of it, see "101 evidences for a young age of the Earth and the universe" for example, which is perhaps the most stunning case. Sam Harris describes the technique as "starting 10 fires in 10 minutes.""

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop

### On Duane Gish

> "Debating opponents said that Gish used a rapid-fire approach during a debate, presenting arguments and changing topics quickly. Eugenie Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education, dubbed this approach the "Gish Gallop," describing it as "where the creationist is allowed to run on for 45 minutes or an hour, spewing forth torrents of error that the evolutionist hasn't a prayer of refuting in the format of a debate."[11] She also criticized Gish for failing to answer objections raised by his opponents.[12] The phrase has also come to be used as a pejorative to describe similar debate styles employed by proponents of other, usually fringe beliefs, such as homeopathy or the moon landing hoax.[13][14]
> 
> Gish was also criticised for using a standardized presentation during debates. While undertaking research for a debate with Gish, Michael Shermer noted that Gish used similar openings, assumptions about his opponent, slides, and even jokes. Although Shermer said that while he stated he was not an atheist and was willing to accept the existence of a divine creator, Gish attempted to prove that Shermer was indeed an atheist and therefore immoral.[15]"

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duane_Gish

This is an immediate 'red flag' to me, similar to someone on the phone with a vested interest in selling things telling me about the wonders about the product. The fact that it is employed immediately shows that the employer does not wish to have individual items receive the time and scrutiny they likely deserve, and is in almost direct opposition to 'real' science: pick a topic/thesis/experiment/field, and evaluate it as thoroughly and in as much detail as current technology, data, and resources will allow.

### Example

Here's an example of the Gish Gallop on the "Nebular Hypothesis" (rife with Category Error)

Some highlights: 
 - "Among the questions the hypothesis fails to answer are where the initial debris came from" (the nebular hypothesis makes no claims whatsoever on how the initial debris got there, it is outside of the purview of the theory which is about planetary formation from existing material)
 - "...how it separated from nearby suns" (again, not within scope, and even if it was the presence of fusion byproducts (anything past CNO) require CORE material, so this is proposed to be supernovae remnants, in separate theories - see Nuclear Synthesis http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/nucsyn.html#c1 )
 - "...how the dust overcame its natural repulsive force to be compressed into planets or the sun" (What natural repulsive force?!?!?! Anti-gravity? Magnetism of Hydrogen?!?)
 - "...why Venus and Uranus rotate in an opposite direction to the other planets" (this is consistent with most variants of the Nebular Hypothesis, and can be modelled in simulations - the result of some combinations of planetescimal collisions will produce retrograde rotation in planets.)

http://www.icr.org/article/nasa-data-derail-nebular-hypothesis/

## Creationist Claims vs. Body of Scientific Literature

Here's one of the claims made by Missler and ICR:

> "The hypothesis that the solar system formed from the collapse of a revolving nebula is contradicted by the fact that three planets and several moons revolve backwards."

... and a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect:

> "The "backwards" planets and moons are in no way contrary to the nebular hypothesis. Part of the hypothesis is that the nebula of gas and dust would accrete into planetessimals. Catastrophic collisions between these would be part of planet building. Such collisions and other natural processes can account for the retrograde planets and moons. 
> 
> The only moons that orbit retrograde are small asteroid-sized distant satellites of giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, plus Triton (Neptune's large moon) and Charon (Pluto's satellite). The small retrograde satellites of Jupiter and Saturn were probably asteroids captured by the giant planets long after formation of the solar system. It is actually easier to be captured into a retrograde orbit. The Neptune system also contains one moon, Nereid, with a highly eccentric orbit. It appears that some sort of violent capture event may have taken place. The Pluto-Charon system is orbiting approximately "on its side," technically retrograde, with tidally locked rotation. As these are small bodies in the outer solar system, and binaries are likely to have been formed through collisions or gravitational capture, this does not violate the nebular hypothesis. 
> 
> Uranus is rotating more or less perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. This may be the result of an off-center collision between two protoplanets during formation. Venus is rotating retrograde but extremely slowly, with its axis almost exactly perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. The rotation of this planet may well have started out prograde, but solar and planetary tides acting on its dense atmosphere have been shown to be a likely cause of the present state of affairs. It is probably not a coincidence that at every inferior conjunction, Venus turns the same side toward Earth, as Earth is the planet that contributes most to tidal forces on Venus. "

## Conclusion

I hope the takeaway from this is simply that if you like Missler's program, and find it entertaining or illuminating in a spiritual sense, by all means purchase anything you like of his. However, his statements do not track with the objective reality that we share, his conceptions of science and fundamentally flawed and because he purports to be 'well researched' that his statements are contrary to even a cursory overview of modern science that he is knowingly cherry picking items that support his objective and does so _fully knowing_ he is cherry picking.

In these first 15 minutes of his video I could not discern anything that was shocking or even interesting, the claims are so off as to be unintelligible or nefariously incorrect with the intent to deceive. SNDM is the modern incarnation of a vast number of models under the category of Nebular Hypothesis (how did the sun form from a gas cloud ("Nebula")?), bears little in common with the original Laplacian models that contain well know issues, and are not taught in science courses as stellar formation (maybe as historical context), all of his claims have been refuted a thousand times and the refutation and resources are readily available to poke serious holes in any position he tries to advance, he uses the Gish Gallop to spray information out there faster than it can be possibly refuted (note the 15 minute : 3 hour ratio it took me to respond, and I'm sure I didn't address every single point he made).

Frustratingly, he makes a straw man out of science and it's claims by attacking his severly flawed notion of how it works, its claims and experiments, methodology, and theories (evolution != abiogenesis, etc.). What doesn't bother me one bit is when people admit honestly (like Ken Ham) that they start from the Bible, and observable reality comes secondary to the Bible and only when it fits the Bible. That's completely earnest, not the way I chose to experience reality but clearly and option that I would defend to the death - freedom of thought. What twerks me is when these "start from the Bible (or Quran, or Torah)" types then abuse and misapply scientific terminology and use persuasion techniques to manipulate and deceive (especially when making a profit off of it). What Missler is attacking is not real science, using incorrect and unverified facts with no sources cited (other than other not-real-science unaccredited organizations like ICR and the Discovery Institute). What this entire charade boils down to is Missler is starting with the Bible, cherry picking scientific jargon and results when they support his presuppositionary position, and presenting it like he's an expert.
